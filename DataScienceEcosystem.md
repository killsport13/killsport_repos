### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python:

1. Addition: **3 + 2** will output **5**
2. Subtraction: **3 - 2** will output **1**
3. Multiplication: **3 * 2** will output **6**
4. Division: **3 / 2** will output **1.5**


```python
# This a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add integers
(3*4)+5
```
